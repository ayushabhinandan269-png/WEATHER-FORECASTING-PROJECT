1. Weather Forecast App--------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview--

This is a simple weather forecast web application made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The app allows the user to search for any city and check its current weather along with a 5-day forecast.
It also includes the feature to check the weather of the userâ€™s current location using the device location.

The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live data.
This project helped me understand how APIs work and how to display data dynamically using JavaScript.

4. How to Run the Project--------------------------------------------------------

a. Download or clone the repository from GitHub:
https://github.com/ayushabhinandan269png/weather-forecast-app

b. Open the project folder in VS Code or any code editor.

c. Make sure all files are in the same folder:

index.html
style.css
script.js
README.md


Right-click on index.html and open it using Live Server (in VS Code).
Or you can directly double-click the file to open it in your browser.

5. API Used-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather details.
The API key is added inside the JavaScript file as shown below:

const API_KEY = "bed4efaf8d2f2abf7049f63d891f609e";


If you want to use your own API key, you can generate it from:
https://openweathermap.org/api
